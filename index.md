### WorkingRemote 6/24/2024
Im at the [East Los Angeles LA COUNTY LiBrary](https://lacountylibrary.org/location/east-los-angeles-library/) and [My girlfriends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyLPnn7yHlk) from [Dance411](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csgo0oU5a_Y) gave me a new schedule. I dont know what Jose is up to but Normani, has been logging all that i do bc she wants to be my IT_Contractor and get a commission from whatever salary i am given once the crime is cleared up. Erika hated me working. 

Im spending more time with [La County](https://lacountylibrary.org/) and [La Public](https://www.lapl.org/) since Longbeach put me out for a month, the guy that put me out might be stalking me for [BET](https://www.bet.com/tag/3cc0pn/latto) but the lady said 30 days, its annoying to readjust [Mayor Karen](https://mayor.lacity.gov/about-mayor-karen-bass) but i dont want crazy charges tossed on him bc the girls from [MagicCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_City_(club) are like still in the community as normal ppl and if he went to a tittie show its a dark as life after that. I studied anatomy to heal the relationships i have with a couple dancers after crushing breakups where they are with NBA players and i have already put my hands in places they are supposed to go again. When the Biology kicks in there is a magnetic field that forms, i dont think [Muna is Dead](https://www.wagesfuneralhome.com/obituaries/muna-ahmed) and while she never performed hiphop vocals in front of me, i think she might be [NickiMinaj](https://www.nickiminajofficial.com/) and hiding from me in a hollywood prostetic mask. Thats why i got mad at [Hollywood Food Coalition](https://hofoco.org/)! about mask soks

[Mrs_Jeffery_Bass?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCALAnECS80) im not going to bother you irl at all unless spoken to! Im letting you know that [Art_Mania](https://boominginla.com/la-arts-district-graffiti-mural-tour-la-art-tours/) done struck and im getting suppressed bc i can code some things that ppl will pay money for and i start sketching and then boom my phone is gone or im kicked out of the library! here are some [TypographySelections](https://codepen.io/thakarashard/pen/gOJeZEj)I hand coded altho i did get

### Basic concepts of flexbox
The flexible box layout module (usually referred to as flexbox) is a one-dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will explore in more detail in the rest of these guides.

Twitter : `twitter.com/mksdsato`
A font family of "Pico -Alphabet Black & White" is Pop and Cute!! There are some different letters between small letters and big letters .Its version was upgraded 2007,on July 2008. Version 3.0 now. I add a postscript. I have received numerous inquiries,which about "Pico-Black" is similar to the logo of "Twitter". Without any doubt, this logo is designed using "Pico-Black". not merely "Similar". this font is used directly for "t,w,i,r". ("t" is the design of old version) "e"is other fonts.

### [Divide and Conquer](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._War_Department_-_Divide_and_Conquer_(1943).webm)

Divide and rule policy (Latin: divide et impera), or divide and conquer, in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power divisively. This includes the exploitation of existing divisions within a political group by its political opponents, and also the deliberate creation or strengthening of such divisions.

The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of Aulus Gabinius exists, parting the Jewish nation into five conventions, reported by Flavius Josephus in Book I, 169â€“170 of The Jewish War (De bello Judaico).[1] Strabo also reports in Geographica, 8.7.3[2] that the Achaean League was gradually dissolved when it became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, as the Romans treated the various states differently, wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.[citation needed]

Elements of this technique involve: [citation needed]

creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign and distributing forces so that they overpower each other.
aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign
fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers
encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending [Read<oreOnWikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule) [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173769/)

### [The Global CTX Mosaic of Mars](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/CTX/index.html)

The Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization has completed a 5.7 terapixel mosaic of the surface of Mars rendered at 5.0 m/px. Each pixel in the mosaic is about the size of a typical parking space, providing unprecedented resolution of the martian surface at the global scale.

We emphasize transparency both in how the mosaic was generated and for users to understand where data in the mosaic come from. We have developed a Python-based pipeline that incorporates non-destructive image processing techniques that preserve all information about the original data that comprise the mosaic and map all seams..
