## Dear_House_of_reps
I have been doing research on the planet mars in public for a bout 4 years. CNN is covering my work and i have trouble eating and communicating. My Family vanished and no Social Security number based resource will aid me. I am struggling with hunger at times and have no shelter. I have women i need to reconnect with to find out what happend. They got kidnapped just b4 covid and tricked me into coming to california, where i was supposed to be headed anyway! And i found out they are victims of a Sex MArket online and the Street Walking and Dancing is just for display. I am complaining about CNN bc Ashley Strickland has no issues communicating from what i see and im stalked and chased by Allied Universal who is the BodyGaurd people of choice of Atlanta's YallyWood and CentralNewsNetwork. I am a native so the girls i was raised to think would be my spouses are up for NBA, Comedy, Film < journalism and everyother industry to deposit semen into. I dont know where my daughter ios from 631 Moreland Ave's illegal eviciton of Rashard Iman Kelly after being denied resources by family services leading to the foprced abduction of Coral Iris Kelly from the home of Copnstancia Arriba. So her i am in Holly wood. I am dating a Popstar named Normani off an on an she plays MineCraft. So thats my side outside. She is really pretty and poses for Vogue but a dark part of her life is that the pictures she takes nude for various publications are used by the local sex trade to keep her marketable for visitors to the city of los angeles and healthy to maintain telepathy for local criminals. She is my best friend(at this level(coral that shit 100bruh)). And since she is mixing with a lot of media i think my blogging gets into the hands of ppl with the power to publish at will. I need balance and a kind cooling center. CNN since we are working to gether can you help me off the streets digitally, can you  help me reconcile my family?
