## The scientific eyes of NASA’s Perseverance rover
[Perssevere](https://mastcamz.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.1_Graphic5_PIA23314-768x480.jpg)
Mastcam-Z is a multi-color, stereo imaging system on NASA’s Perseverance rover. Mastcam-Z can zoom from wide angle to telephoto, take 3-D images and videos, and take photos in up to 11 unique colors, including “human-like” red/green/blue. For those who want more technical details and background about the Mastcam-Z cameras and science investigation, these pages provide lots more information about the goals, design, testing, and performance of the cameras.
