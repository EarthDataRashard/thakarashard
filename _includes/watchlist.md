Originally, [Reefer Madness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028346/) was the title of a 1930’s American propaganda film that told the story of how an entire high school student body was introduced to smoking marijuana cigarettes (also known as, reefers).1 However, while the film was intentioned as a cautionary tale to parents about the grave and immoral consequences of allowing their kids to [smoke marijuana](https://weedmaps.com/) (i.e. murder, kidnapping, rape, automotive homicide), it was soon made satire by critics and advocates alike.

## The Vanishing Private
The war continues in the 1942 [Disney_Shorts](https://www.disneyplus.com/editorial/shorts) with one of my absolute favorites – The Vanishing Private. Donald Duck, who normally plays the role of frustrated working man, gets an upgrade to be the antagonist of this short, playing off of Pete. And he does it all while enlisted in the Army, as we saw in Donald Gets Drafted. - [ReadMorE](http://www.disneyfilmproject.com/2010/09/vanishing-private.html) - [disneyfilmproject](http://www.disneyfilmproject.com/)

[Donald_Fauntleroy_Duck](https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/stories/donald-duck-american-diplomat) is an American cartoon character from The Walt Disney Company. Donald is a white anthropomorphic duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He usually wears a sailor shirt, cap, and a red bow tie, but no trousers. Donald’s most famous personality trait is his easily provoked and explosive temper. Donald Duck has been officially honored as the third most popular cartoon character of all time with Bugs Bunny of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies at number two and fellow Disney creation Mickey Mouse who is number one.

# Marvel Super Heroes 1967
In 1966, Marvel Comics hired animation company Grantray-Laurence to create "The Marvel Superheroes", a series of daily cartoons based on their titles Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and the Sub-Mariner. As it was Marvel's first foray into television animation, the producers stretched out the budget by using existing stories and artwork. Original comic art pages were Xeroxed and used as key frames, with animators adding only mouth and limb animation. Body movement was often accomplished by animating still images across a background. 

Fortunately for comic fans, this cost-cutting move preserved for all time the original artwork of Gene Colon, Don Heck, and Jack "King" Kirby, and the dialog of Stan Lee. It was exactly what readers have always asked TV and movie makers to do: just film the comics.

## [ABC Network](https://abc.com/) - The Flintstones - "Fred's Flying Lesson" (Promo, 1965)
Here (from an original 2" Quad tape) is a promo for The Flintstones episode "Fred's Flying Lesson," to air at 7:30pm (6:30pm Central time).

This promo starts with a "swinging" RCA TK-60 black-and-white camera with an 'abc' sticker on the side (this was their ID between 1964 and 1966). Also, although this promo was in black-and-white, The Flintstones itself aired in color by this point on the network (one of the very few prior to their increasing color programming in the 1965-66 season).

Ending voiceover by ??

This promo aired on local Chicago TV on Friday, January 1st 1965 at about 6:29pm.
