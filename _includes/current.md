Originally established as a separate records system, the white slave traffic act cases were incorporated into the central filing system that the Bureau adopted from the Justice Department in 1921. The act was codified in U.S. Code Title 18 and prohibited transportation of women or girls in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or other immoral purposes, the coercion or enticement of women or girls for this purpose, and the coercion or enticement of female minors.

It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois. In its original form, the act made it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of "any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking, particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution. It was one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the Progressive Era. In practice, its ambiguous language about "immorality" resulted in it being used to criminalize even consensual sexual behavior between adults.[1] It was amended by Congress in 1978 and again in 1986 to limit its application to transport for the purpose of prostitution or other illegal sexual acts [Editorial: Mayor Bass vetoed a police discipline ballot measure. Now she has to help create a new one](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-17/editorial-mayor-bass-vetoed-police-discipline-ballot-measure-now-what) ['White slavery': the origins of the anti-trafficking movement](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/beyond-trafficking-and-slavery/white-slavery-origins-of-anti-trafficking-movement/) A nineteenth century drive to protect the morality of white women created the concept of ‘human trafficking’, and its legacies live on in border control systems and slavery-based campaigning.
