[Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) 
 is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by `allowing you to provide` a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.

Understanding MIME Sniffing#
MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and it is a standard used to identify the type of content being sent over the internet, such as text, images, audio, video, and application files. MIME types are defined in the HTTP header of web requests and responses.

MIME sniffing, on the other hand, is a browser behavior that attempts to guess the MIME type of a resource if it is not explicitly specified in the HTTP header... [LearnMore](https://www.keycdn.com/support/glossary)

[What Is a Browser Hash?](https://seon.io/resources/dictionary/browser-hash/) A browser hash is a string of numbers and letters created to map data related to a user’s browser. [What the hash?](https://docs.seon.io/knowledge-base/device-fingerprinting/understanding-hashes#overview)
So what exactly is a hash? Simply put, a hash is a string of numbers and letters containing information about the desktop or mobile device someone uses to access your service. It is an accumulation of the device data we gather. [Using hashes to fight fraud](https://docs.seon.io/knowledge-base/device-fingerprinting/understanding-hashes#learn-more)

[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) is a programming paradigm introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given as an explanation of how it works in a natural language, such as English, interspersed (embedded) with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.[1] The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access purposes.[2] Literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today.[3]]

[Is there any crossbrowser solution for playing flac? (or is it possible in theory to make one)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20557049/is-there-any-crossbrowser-solution-for-playing-flac-or-is-it-possible-in-theor)
![FLAC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/FLAC_logo_vector.svg)
FLAC (/flæk/; Free Lossless Audio Codec) is an audio coding format for lossless compression of digital audio, developed by the [Xiph.Org Foundation](https://xiph.org/),FLAC is specifically designed for efficient packing of audio data, unlike general-purpose lossless algorithms such as DEFLATE, which are used in ZIP and gzip. While ZIP may reduce the size of a CD-quality audio file by 10–20%, FLAC is able to reduce the size of audio data by 40–50% by taking advantage of the characteristics of audio.
