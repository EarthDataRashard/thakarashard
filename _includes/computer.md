# Computing

[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) is a programming paradigm introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given as an explanation of how it works in a natural language, such as English, interspersed (embedded) with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.[1] The approach is used in scientific computing and in data science routinely for reproducible research and open access purposes.[2] Literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today.[3]]

[Is there any crossbrowser solution for playing flac? (or is it possible in theory to make one)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20557049/is-there-any-crossbrowser-solution-for-playing-flac-or-is-it-possible-in-theor)
![FLAC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/FLAC_logo_vector.svg)
FLAC (/flæk/; Free Lossless Audio Codec) is an audio coding format for lossless compression of digital audio, developed by the [Xiph.Org Foundation](https://xiph.org/),FLAC is specifically designed for efficient packing of audio data, unlike general-purpose lossless algorithms such as DEFLATE, which are used in ZIP and gzip. While ZIP may reduce the size of a CD-quality audio file by 10–20%, FLAC is able to reduce the size of audio data by 40–50% by taking advantage of the characteristics of audio.
